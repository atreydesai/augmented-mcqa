A, in unbearable pain and wishing to end his life, told Doctor B that he felt better and asked B to stop active medication. B understood A's intention, and three days later, A passed away. Regarding this case, which of the following statements is correct?\nExisting 4 Options: A: B's actions have not been clearly defined under our Constitution and laws\nB: B's behavior constitutes the crime of negligence leading to death, as he failed to perform his professional duty to save a patient's life\nC: The cessation of treatment is strictly a civil matter regarding the medical service contract and does not fall under the jurisdiction of criminal law\nD: B's actions are considered a \"justifiable emergency\" under the law because they were intended to relieve Citizen A from unbearable physical suffering\nAnswer: A: B's actions have not been clearly defined under our Constitution and laws\n\nPlease generate only the six new incorrect options E, F, G, H, I, and J.

    "qadm_model_output": "E: B's behavior constitutes intentional homicide, as a doctor has a statutory obligation to save lives and the cessation of treatment directly led to the patient's death.\nF: B's actions represent a fulfillment of the patient's right to self-determination and human dignity, making the behavior legally valid under modern medical ethics.\nG: Since B acted solely upon the patient's express request, it constitutes \"consent of the victim,\" which serves as a complete justification for excluding criminal liability.\nH: B's behavior is categorized as an administrative violation of medical practitioner regulations and should be handled through medical license revocation rather than criminal prosecution.\nI: B's actions are considered a form of \"passive euthanasia,\" which is currently explicitly permitted and regulated by specific provisions within the Criminal Law.\nJ: There is no legal causality between B's action and A's death because the underlying terminal illness was the ultimate cause of the patient's passing.",
