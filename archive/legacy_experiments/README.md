# Legacy Experiment Archive

This archive stores pre-Final5 experiment surfaces that are no longer active.

## Included

- legacy experiment scripts and matrix planners
- legacy plotting/analysis scripts
- legacy SLURM wrappers
- legacy tests tied to old presets/columns
- legacy provider/model client code paths that were removed from active registry

## Not Included

- old generated datasets/results artifacts (those remain under `datasets/` and `results/` history as data artifacts)
- active Final5 configs and scripts

Active code should use only the Final5 workflow.
